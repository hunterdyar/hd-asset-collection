This website is a collection of free to use assets. My goal is to help make immersive media and game development easier for students.
Check the license information on each asset, and see my [guidebook](https://guidebook.hdyar.com) for information on how to use/implement them. *Remember, students, even if an asset has a public domain license, you still need to provide credit for any of my assignments.*

The assets here are by [me](http://hdyar.com) or by student workers, creating and releasing them as part of their work. If you would like to contribute your assets, email me. No assets made for coursework can be accepted.
